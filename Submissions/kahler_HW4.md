Homework 4 Written Assignment
Due 21 Sept. 2020

1) Include discussion of the quantitative analysis that lead to your prediction. This can include any analysis you complete but must include 
   at least two histograms and some quantitative discussion of flow quantiles that helped you make your decision.

This time I only looked at the five year, two year, and one year historical data to inform my forecasts, with emphasis on the one-year.
For the two week forecasts, I looked at the data per week and created histograms and also calculated the flow quantiles. The distribution
of flow values illustrated in the quantiles informed my selection of forecast values by showing the distribution of historic values.

2) Describe the variable flow_data:
What is it? 
  It is an array with four columns [year, month, day, flow] 
What type of values is is composed of? 
  It is composed of floats.
What is are its dimensions, and total size? 
  It has four columns and 11585 rows, so the total size must the 46340 values contained within the array.

3)How many times was the daily flow greater than your prediction in the month of September (express your answer in terms of the total number of times and as a percentage)?
943 times = 93.4%

4) How would your answer to the previous question change if you considered only daily flows in or before 2000? 
It would be 360 times and 100%
   Same question for the flows in or after the year 2010? (again report total number of times and percentage)
This would be 313/319 times for 98.1%

5) How does the daily flow generally change from the first half of September to the second?
It usually increased in the second half of September, but in 2019 there was only a slight increase.
