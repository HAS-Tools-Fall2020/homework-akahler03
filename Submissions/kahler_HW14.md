#### Paper title:
A model-independent iterative ensemble smoother for efficient history-matching\
and uncertainty quantification in very high dimensions

Jeremy White, 2018

**1.**
This paper describes a tool, pestpp-ies, part of the PEST++ suite,\
developed to increase computation efficiency and express uncertainty\
for iterative models containing thousands of parameters. It is open\
source and intended to be readily applied by other users.

**2.**
Github repo link:\
https://github.com/dwelter/pestpp\
The github repository for this paper was introduced in a beginning\
paragraph before the introduction, with the stated purpose of\
reproducibility. The github ReadMe rerouted to a more current github\
account:\
https://github.com/jtwhite79/pestpp

**3.**
The ReadMe in each repo was helpful in providing a big picture, and\
provided links to the PEST++ users manual and other supporting\
information. This is considerate to someone at my level who may be\
new to existing parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification\
"iterative Ensemble Smoothers" that are generally standard in\
groundwater modeling.

The scripts in the repo seemed to be just updates, changing paths and\
renaming directories. The publication referenced binaries in the\
repo, and I think this is why I didn't recognize what I was looking\
at. The journal article provided links to supplementary information\
that I found helpful, and surprisingly beginner-friendly. This is\
probably because White is an advocate for reproducibility, to show\
the validity of these methods, so he goes further with his\
documentation than may generally be expected.\

**4.**
The repo took a very long time to clone, yet did not seem to have\
much in it. A portion of the files seemed to me to be hidden type\
files; doing their work in the background and not of concern to me. I\
wondered if the purpose of the repo was not to run the entire script,\
but to provide the setup information that was used to generate\
figures. Surprisingly, the first download file in "supplementary\
data" opened an error box that said data was available upon request.\
There was an accessible pdf file that provided details of the\
arguments used in the code, and the figures and map images produced\
by it.

**5.**
I was not able to access the data. The error that appeared when I\
clicked the data download link showed an email for J. White, and I am\
curious if the request process is as simple as that, or if it\
requires specific clearance and purpose. (ie, would it be released to\
  me just for experimenting with it.)

**6.**
The organization of the repo, especially the ReadMe, was a good\
takeaway. The ReadMe showed all of its edits or additions with the\
dates they were made and I think I could take many of my submissions\
comments, fixes, and goals and keep a running tally in my ReadMe.\
This would help me remember to revisit what I had wanted to improve\
the previous week, and would present a more coherent process to the\
another user.
