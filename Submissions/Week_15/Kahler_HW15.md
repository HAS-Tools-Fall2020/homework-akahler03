#### Homework 15

**1. Ocelote**\
The resources I requested through the job builder were 1 node, 1 core\
standard queue for 5 minutes. The wait was nearly instantaneous and it ran for 6\
seconds.
0:00:06 (0:00:06 X 1 cpus)

**2. Confusing Parts**\
The most confusing part was troubleshooting when it wouldn't run. It was fun going\
back and forth with classmates over the weekend and getting new errors as a sign that\
we were making progress, although I pared my script down to bare bones in the\
process. After all of that exploring, it was easier to navigate the fixes during office hours.

**3. Second Run**\
I also ran this on Colab. It seemed too easy and I wondered if I was in the right place. I\
googled about running it locally vs. on the cloud and changed the runtime time to GPU.\
I think I prefer Ocelote because it was easier to see the processes going on behind the\
scenes.

**4. Observations**\
I am curious how Colab coexists along private supercomputers. I think it just relies on\
people using it responsibly, and maybe the people who would max it out are already\
using their institution's resources. When I was reading about Colab I did see a section\
discouraging the use of GPU unless it was really needed.
