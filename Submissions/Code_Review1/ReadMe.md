# Week 7 Instructions for running forecast
\
I have included directional comments in each cell to explain its purpose and\
to instruct if it requires input. My new function starts in cell 48 and is\
utilized in the next cell. I would like to improve this section with a for loop\
but was having difficulty with setup. \
\
The flow comparison is followed by two line graphs that I use to help inform\
how I will shift my AR model forecast to be more realistic. I have chosen to\
focus my calculations on recent years and only Septembers and Octobers.\
\
**Week One Forecast (cell 140):**\
\
\
**Week Two Forecast (cell 143):**\
\
\
**Autoregressive model week one forecast (cell 128):**\
\
\
**Autoregressive model week two forecast (cell 134):**
