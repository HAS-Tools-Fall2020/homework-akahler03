For this week's forecast I used the starter code to advance the cfs plots through time, and used the visual of patterns to make new estimates. I did however run into an issue with my y-axis values and will attend office hours this week to help identify why that was happening. Because the cfs values were incrimentally increasing through time as well, I had to weigh the plot shapes against last week's Excel work.

3/3 - Good job. We can definitely discuss in office hours.
I didn't take off points but next time please be sure to include a header with you name, date, etc.
